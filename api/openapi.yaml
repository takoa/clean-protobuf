                A server-to-client streaming RPC.

                 Obtains the Features available within the given Rectangle.  Results are
                 streamed rather than returned at once (e.g. in a response message with a
                 repeated field), as the rectangle may cover a large area and contain a
                 huge number of features.

                A simple RPC.

                 Obtains the feature at a given position.

                 A feature with an empty name is returned if there's no feature at the given
                 position.

            description: 'The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).'
